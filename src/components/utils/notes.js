// Routing

//  for routing - use library react router dom  - npm i react-router-dom
// Use Outlet in react router to navigate to differet pages and keep header intact
// use children routes to navigate to differet paths
// use Link to have fucntionality to move to another page, it will work as anchor tag.

// when we have to export multiple varibales/ functions, then we need to use named export. we can write export directly in front of the variables and functions which need to be exported.

// its a good practice to write Constants in capital letters.
